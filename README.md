# Stock-Market-prediction-using-SVR-and-LSTM
This project tries to combine historical price data and sentiment data to predict the stock price and both SVR and LSTM models are compared before and after including the sentiment data
# Environment setup
This project executed on Jupyter notebook using python language
# models used 
SVR and LSTM and VADER
